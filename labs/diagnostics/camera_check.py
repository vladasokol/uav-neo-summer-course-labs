"""
Diagnostic: grab one frame from each camera and run the labs' vision on it, so you can
confirm the real cameras process the same way the simulator's do. It does not fly.

    sim:   drone sim course/camera_check.py       (press ENTER in the sim window)
    drone: python3 camera_check.py                (runs immediately; no flight)

Point the forward camera at a gate and the downward camera at the line (colored tape or a
white LED strip - both masks are run and saved), then compare the
printed detections and the saved images against a sim run. Watch the image shapes: the labs
assume a 640-wide image (COL_CENTER=320, IMAGE_WIDTH=640, FOCAL_PX=320); a different real
resolution means those per-camera constants need real values.
