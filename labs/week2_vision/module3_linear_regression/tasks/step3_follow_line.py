    # GOAL: follow the line by turning to face along it. Fly forward at FORWARD_PITCH;
    # split the line pixels into a FAR part (top of the view, where you are heading) and a
    # NEAR part (bottom, under you). Yaw toward the far part to steer through curves; roll
    # toward the near part for fine lateral centering.
    #
    # Tools: drone.camera.get_downward_image(); neo_lab.saturated_mask(image, S_MIN);
    #        np.argwhere(mask) -> line pixel (row, col); uav_utils.clamp(...);
    #        drone.flight.send_pcmd(pitch, roll, yaw, throttle).
    #
    # Split rows at rows.min() + (rows.max()-rows.min())*LOOKAHEAD_FRAC. The far part's mean
    # column vs IMAGE_CENTER gives a yaw error (clamp to MAX_YAW); the near part's gives a
    # roll error (clamp to MAX_ROLL). With too few line pixels, hover and count the time as
    # lost. Finish when the line has been lost for LOST_TIME (its end) or _timer hits MAX_FOLLOW.
